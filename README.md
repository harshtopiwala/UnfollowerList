This application wokrs only on desktops.
It is created with the intent of knowing the unfollowers on the 
social-media platform "Instagram".
This application is different from other apps on playstore or
websites because:
1) it does not use web scraping.
2) it does not ask for the id or password of the users.
3) instagram wont know that you used a progarm.
